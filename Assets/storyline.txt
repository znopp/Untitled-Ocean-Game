optional storyline:
	you were on a routine ocean expedition mission, terrible weather caused the ship to sink and you fell to the bottom of the ocean. without a safety line you cant get up

	conveniently the weapons storage and other useful items fell along with you, and from the scraps laying around you were able to build together a comforting stall that you can use to upgrade your items

	you could just not pay, but you're worried that you'll be fined for taking items from the storage without having paid anything, so instead you rob a shark to get a harpoon

	they didn't have much money, so you could only afford the old and rusty one

	now all the sharks are mad at you and won't leave you alone until you leave

	thankfully the sheep society knows that you are in danger, and all you have to do is survive for <some time>
