# Untitled Ocean Game

## Preamble

This game was made for a game jam contest in spring of 2024. Together with a friend, we banged out the 0.1.0 release in just a few days, and ended up winning a prize for "most creative/original gameplay" out of the bunch. If you ask me, we should have won the prize for the game art, but I will take it :P

I decided to take it upon myself to continue development on my own. Over the past 9 months I have on and off updated the game, and as of now I am happy with the current state of the game. 

## Versions

In the Releases section are every version of the game I have built. Up until version 0.9.0, it was only built for Windows, but 0.9.0 and forward have been and will be created for Windows, Linux and MacOS. I achieve this by using Unity's own build tool, so if something is broken, it is not because of me!

## Attribution

In every version of the game created, as seen under the Releases section, the description includes attribution for music used. 

For sound effects, there is an up-to-date ``Attribution.md`` file in every attached file in the releases. For a quick look, __the list below is updated for version 0.9.1.__
